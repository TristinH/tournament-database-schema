Instructions to run:

	The functions in tournament.py are reliant on a specifically structured database. To be able to use those functions you must first establish the database schema found in tournament.sql. The easiest way to do this is to open the PostgreSQL terminal (psql) and type the command \i tournament.sql. This will automatically establish the database (beware that the file is setup to drop any database already present named tournament). Alternatively you could copy all the commands and paste them into your terminal and run them from there. Once the database is set up, you can use the functions found in tournament.py. To test everything is working properly, you can run tournament_test.py by using the command python tournament_test.py in the shell. If the message returned ends with "Success! All tests pass!" then everything is working properly. To use the functions in your program, copy tournament.py into the same directory as your development directory and ensure you include the statment 'import tournament' at the top of your file. For explanations on what the various functions do, see the commented porition above each function definition in tournament.py.
